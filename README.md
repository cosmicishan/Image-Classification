# Image-Classification

I started learning fast.ai v3 Practical Deep Learning for Coders from youtube by Jeremy Howard. The first lectuer was all about image classification and they worked onpet datasets. By gaining the knowledge through that course I implemented it myself. 

In Second notebook, I implement mnist_sample dataset and classify between 3 and 7 which was homework problem of the course.
